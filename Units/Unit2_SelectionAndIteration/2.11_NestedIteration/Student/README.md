# Lab 2.11 – Nested Iteration

## 🎯 Learning Goals (I can…)
- I can trace and write nested loops that generate 2D patterns.
- I can compute with nested loops over 2D arrays (rows × columns).
- I can reason about time complexity of nested loops (O(n^2)).
- I can avoid common nesting pitfalls (incorrect inner initialization, off‑by‑one).

## 📖 Pre‑Lab Reading
- CSAwesome 2.11 – Nested Iteration (included HTML)

## ⚙️ Setup
1. Clone the repo from GitHub Classroom.
2. Open `MainProgram.java` in VS Code (Java Extension Pack).
3. Complete each `q#()` where you see `TODO`.

## 📝 Tasks
Implement each method in `MainProgram.java`:
1. q1 – Print an n×n square of '#'.
2. q2 – Print a right triangle of '*' of height n.
3. q3 – Multiplication table n×n with padded columns.
4. q4 – Count border cells in an n×n grid using nested loops.
5. q5 – 2D array sum: Given `int[][] m`, compute total sum and max element.
6. q6 – AP trace: Draw a hollow rectangle of size r×c using characters.

## 🚀 Stretch Goals
- Add a `q7()` that extends the lab’s theme (creative).

## 🎟 Exit Ticket (PR comment)
- In 1–2 sentences, explain one bug you prevented today and how.
