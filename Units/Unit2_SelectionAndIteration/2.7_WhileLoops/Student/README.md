# Lab 2.7 – While Loops

## 🎯 Learning Goals (I can…)
- I can construct and trace `while` loops using counters and sentinels.
- I can prevent infinite loops and fix off‑by‑one errors using loop invariants and clear exit conditions.
- I can use input validation patterns and accumulation with `while` loops.
- I can compare `while` vs `for` and choose the right tool for the job.

## 📖 Pre‑Lab Reading
- CSAwesome 2.7 – While Loops (included HTML)

## ⚙️ Setup
1. Clone from GitHub Classroom.
2. Open `MainProgram.java` in VS Code (Java Extension Pack).
3. Complete each `q#()` method where you see `TODO`.

## 📝 Tasks
Implement each method in `MainProgram.java`:

1. **q1 – Counter loop warm‑up:** Print numbers 1..10 on one line, then 10..1 on the next.
2. **q2 – Sum & average:** Repeatedly read ints until user enters 0 (sentinel). Print count, sum, and average (guard count=0).
3. **q3 – Input validation:** Prompt until user enters an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive; then print `"OK"`.
4. **q4 – Digit count:** Given a positive integer `n`, count how many digits using repeated division by 10 (no strings).
5. **q5 – Guessing game:** Random secret 1..50; loop until guessed; give high/low hints; count attempts.
6. **q6 – Off‑by‑one debug:** A broken `while` is given—fix the loop so it prints exactly 5 stars.
   - Then explain in a comment what caused the original bug.

## 🚀 Stretch Goals
- `q7()` Build a multiplication table printer using nested `while` loops (size from user).

## 🎟 Exit Ticket (PR comment)
- In one sentence, explain how a **sentinel** differs from a **counter** loop.
- Give one invariant for your `q5` guessing loop.
