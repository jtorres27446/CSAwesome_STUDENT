# Lab 2.10 – Implementing String Algorithms

## 🎯 Learning Goals (I can…)
- I can iterate through a String using charAt and length.
- I can implement common string operations (reverse, count, search, replace).
- I can use substring/indexOf to solve substring problems.
- I can reason about case sensitivity and whitespace when processing text.

## 📖 Pre‑Lab Reading
- CSAwesome 2.10 – Implementing String Algorithms (included HTML)

## ⚙️ Setup
1. Clone the repo from GitHub Classroom.
2. Open `MainProgram.java` in VS Code (Java Extension Pack).
3. Complete each `q#()` where you see `TODO`.

## 📝 Tasks
Implement each method in `MainProgram.java`:
1. q1 – Count vowels (a,e,i,o,u) in `String s` (case‑insensitive).
2. q2 – Reverse a string without using StringBuilder.reverse().
3. q3 – Palindrome check ignoring case and spaces (e.g., 'Never Odd Or Even').
4. q4 – Substring count: Count how many times `sub` occurs in `s` (allow overlaps).
5. q5 – Replace: Build a new string with all digits removed from `s`.
6. q6 – AP trace: Given `s="abracadabra"`, compute frequency of each character 'a'..'z' and print top 3.

## 🚀 Stretch Goals
- Add a `q7()` that extends the lab’s theme (creative).

## 🎟 Exit Ticket (PR comment)
- In 1–2 sentences, explain one bug you prevented today and how.
