# 🧠 Lab 2.4 - Nested If Statements
**Unit:** 2 - Control Structures  
**Curriculum:** CSAwesome 2025  
**Type:** Student Version  

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- I can design nested if statements to handle multiple conditions.
- I can trace control flow in layered decision structures.
- I can identify when to simplify nesting using else-if or logic operators.

---

## 🧩 Pre-Lab (Prediction)
Predict the output without running:
```java
int x = 8;
if (x > 5) {
    if (x < 10) {
        System.out.println("A");
    } else {
        System.out.println("B");
    }
}
System.out.println("C");
```

---

## ⚙️ Setup
1. Create a new file `NestedIfLab.java`.
2. Copy the starter code and complete each method.
3. Test your work by printing each output clearly.

## 🧭 Tasks

### ✅ basicNestedIf()
Write a nested if that checks if a number is positive, and if so, whether it’s even or odd.

### ✅ loginSystem()
Simulate a simple login: check username, then password.

### ✅ gradeEligibility()
Determine if a student is eligible for honors based on grade and conduct score.

### ✅ ticketDiscount()
Calculate senior ticket discounts (65+) and extra discount for members.

### ✅ scopePractice()
Declare variables inside and outside nested blocks to observe scope.

---

## 🚀 Stretch Goals
- Add user input via `Scanner` for `loginSystem()` or `ticketDiscount()`.
- Refactor one method to use `if-else-if` instead of nested `if`s and compare readability.

## 🎟 Exit Ticket (Used for Reflection Footer)

2. Which nested condition could be simplified using logic operators?
3. What did you learn about scope in nested blocks?
