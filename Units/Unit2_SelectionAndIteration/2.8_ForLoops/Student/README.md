# Lab 2.8 – For Loops

## 🎯 Learning Goals (I can…)
- I can construct and trace for loops with correct initialization, condition, and update.
- I can avoid off‑by‑one errors by reasoning about boundaries.
- I can use accumulation patterns (sum, count, min/max) with for loops.
- I can choose between for and while based on problem constraints.

## 📖 Pre‑Lab Reading
- CSAwesome 2.8 – For Loops (included HTML)

## ⚙️ Setup
1. Clone the repo from GitHub Classroom.
2. Open `MainProgram.java` in VS Code (Java Extension Pack).
3. Complete each `q#()` where you see `TODO`.

## 📝 Tasks
Implement each method in `MainProgram.java`:
1. q1 – Print 1..20 on one line, then 20..1 on the next using two for loops.
2. q2 – Compute the sum of 1..n (n=100) and print the result.
3. q3 – Given an array `int[] a = {3,9,2,9,5,9};` count occurrences of the maximum value.
4. q4 – Print all multiples of 7 from 7..140 inclusive; then print only those also divisible by 5.
5. q5 – Approximate π using the Leibniz series for 100000 terms and print the partial sum (double).
6. q6 – AP trace: For a given string `s="banana"`, use a for loop to count 'a' and 'n'; print counts.

## 🚀 Stretch Goals
- Add a `q7()` that extends the lab’s theme (creative).

## 🎟 Exit Ticket (PR comment)
- In 1–2 sentences, explain one bug you prevented today and how.
