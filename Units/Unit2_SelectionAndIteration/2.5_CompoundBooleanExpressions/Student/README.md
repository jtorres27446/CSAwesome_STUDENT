# Lab 2.5 – Compound Boolean Expressions

## 🎯 Learning Goals (I can…)
- I can evaluate compound boolean expressions with `&&`, `||`, and `!`.
- I can explain short‑circuit evaluation and predict when the right‑hand side runs.
- I can use parentheses and operator precedence to control evaluation order.

## 📖 Pre‑Lab Reading
- CSAwesome 2.5 – Compound Boolean Expressions (included HTML)

## ⚙️ Setup
- Clone the repo from GitHub Classroom.
- Open `MainProgram.java` in VS Code (Java Extension Pack).
- Complete each `q#()` method where you see `TODO`.

## 📝 Tasks
Implement each method in `MainProgram.java`:
1. **q1 – Warmup truth checks:** Use `&&`, `||`, and `!` to print whether a student passes given two flags.
2. **q2 – Safe division with guard:** Use short‑circuiting to avoid division by zero while testing a condition.
3. **q3 – Range checks (inclusive/exclusive):** Write idiomatic range tests (e.g., 18–65) and print results.
4. **q4 – Precedence & parentheses:** Show how adding parentheses changes outcomes; print both versions.
5. **q5 – Username validation:** Combine multiple boolean checks (length, first char, and allowed chars).
6. **q6 – AP‑style trace:** Given three booleans, compute a final expression and print each sub‑step.

## 🚀 Stretch Goals
- Add a method `q7()` that builds and prints a truth table for `p`, `q` with `!p`, `p&&q`, `p||q`.
