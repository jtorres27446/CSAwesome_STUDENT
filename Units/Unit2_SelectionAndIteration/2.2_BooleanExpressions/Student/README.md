# 🧠 Lab 2.2 - Boolean Expressions
**Unit:** 2 - Control Structures  
**Curriculum:** CSAwesome 2025  
**Type:** Student Version  

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- I can write Boolean expressions using relational and logical operators.  
- I can predict outcomes of compound Boolean statements.  
- I can describe how short-circuit evaluation works.  
- I can explain how Boolean logic drives decision-making in programs.  

---

## 🧩 Pre-Lab
1. What is a Boolean expression?  
2. How does the `==` operator differ from the assignment `=` operator?  
3. What does short-circuit evaluation mean?  

---

## ⚙️ Setup
1. Open VS Code and create a new file named `BooleanExpressionsLab.java`.  
2. Copy the starter code from this lab.  
3. Save it inside your `Unit2_ControlStructures` folder.

## 🧭 Tasks
Each TODO corresponds to a method in your program.

### ✅ describeLesson()
Explain what Boolean expressions are and their purpose in programming.

### ✅ comparisonExamples()
Use relational operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`) and print the results.

### ✅ logicalExamples()
Use logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) and explain what each does.

### ✅ shortCircuitDemo()
Write a short-circuit example to show how Java stops evaluating once the result is known.

### ✅ reflectionOutput()
Print one or two sentences explaining how Boolean logic helps create decision-based programs.

## 🚀 Stretch Goals
- Combine relational and logical expressions (e.g., `(a > b) && (b > c)`).  
- Explore De Morgan’s Laws in Java: `!(A && B)` vs `!A || !B`.

## 🎟 Exit Ticket
Answer the following in a comment at the bottom of your code:  
1. What’s the difference between `&&` and `||`?  
2. Why is short-circuit evaluation efficient?  
3. Give a real-world example of a Boolean condition.
