# Lab 2.1 - Designing Algorithms with Selection and Repetition
**Unit:** 2 - Control Structures  
**Curriculum:** CSAwesome 2025  
**Type:** Conceptual Lab (Pseudocode & Flowcharts)  

## Learning Goals
- I can explain what an algorithm is and why structure matters.  
- I can represent algorithm logic using pseudocode and flowchart symbols.  
- I can apply selection (if/else) and repetition (loops) conceptually.  
- I can plan an algorithm before coding.  

## Tasks

### Task 1 - Pseudocode: Positive Check
Write pseudocode for an algorithm that:  
1. Reads a number  
2. If the number > 0, prints "positive"  
3. Otherwise, prints "not positive"  

### Task 2 - Flowchart Design
Draw a flowchart for Task 1 using:  
- Oval for Start/End  
- Diamond for the decision (num > 0 ?)  
- Rectangle for output steps  

### Task 3 - Repetition Pseudocode
Write pseudocode for a loop that prints numbers 1 through 10.  

### Task 4 - Challenge Algorithm
Design pseudocode that finds the sum of all even numbers between 1-20.  

### Task 5 - Reflection
Write a short paragraph explaining:  
- Why programmers use pseudocode and flowcharts before coding  
- How repetition helps simplify complex tasks  

## Deliverables
- Pseudocode written in Pseudocode_Template.txt  
- A .png, .jpg, or .pdf of your flowchart(s)  
- Reflection paragraph in README or comment block  

## Submission Checklist
- [ ] Pseudocode complete for all tasks  
- [ ] Flowchart image attached  
- [ ] Reflection paragraph included  
- [ ] Uploaded via GitHub Classroom
