# Lab 2.9 – Implementing Selection and Iteration Algorithms

## 🎯 Learning Goals (I can…)
- I can combine conditionals and loops to implement common algorithms.
- I can trace and implement linear search and frequency counting.
- I can track running min/max with guard initialization.
- I can refactor complex if/loop code into clear, maintainable methods.

## 📖 Pre‑Lab Reading
- CSAwesome 2.9 – Implementing Selection and Iteration Algorithms (included HTML)

## ⚙️ Setup
1. Clone the repo from GitHub Classroom.
2. Open `MainProgram.java` in VS Code (Java Extension Pack).
3. Complete each `q#()` where you see `TODO`.

## 📝 Tasks
Implement each method in `MainProgram.java`:
1. q1 – Linear search: Return the index of target in `int[] a`, or −1 if not found.
2. q2 – Frequency count: Count evens in `int[] a` and print the count.
3. q3 – Min/Max: Compute both min and max in one pass and print them.
4. q4 – Running longest streak: Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest run of the same char.
5. q5 – Two‑pass filter: Print all numbers in `int[] a` that are in the inclusive range [L..R].
6. q6 – AP trace: Given `int[] b={2,5,5,3,2,2,5}`, compute the mode (most frequent value).

## 🚀 Stretch Goals
- Add a `q7()` that extends the lab’s theme (creative).

## 🎟 Exit Ticket (PR comment)
- In 1–2 sentences, explain one bug you prevented today and how.
