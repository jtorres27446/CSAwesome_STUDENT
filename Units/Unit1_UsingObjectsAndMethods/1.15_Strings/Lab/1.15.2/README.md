# 🔐 Lab 1.15 – Strings: Secret Message Decoder

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Use String methods to manipulate text
- Read and process user input with Scanner
- Build an encoding and decoding system

## ⚙️ Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open SecretMessageDecoder.java in VS Code.
3. Follow each TODO and test your logic.

## 📝 Tasks
- q1: Prompt for message and print its length
- q2: Print first and last character
- q3: Encode the message by shifting each letter +1 Unicode value
- q4: Decode the message
- q5: Ask for a secret key word and hide it between letters

## 🎟 Exit Ticket
Reflect at the bottom of your .java file:
1. What String method was most useful?
2. How did encoding/decoding reinforce your understanding of immutability?
3. What challenges did you face?
